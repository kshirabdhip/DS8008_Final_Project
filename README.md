# Embedded topic model using neural networks

## Why the topic model?
Instead of writing an extended boring definition of the topic model, I will try to justify the topic model's importance with an example. Suppose you are organizing a library, and we have no clue about the books the library has. Now, how can you do that? A topic model can help here. Topic models are a statistical framework that helps users understand large document collections: not just to find individual documents but also to understand the general themes present in the collection. Using the topic model, we can know the content of the book as well as also find out all the books having similar content. In this way, we can organize a library by keeping similar books together in a particular section.

## Application of topic models:
Topic models can be used for various application few of them are:
1.	Ad-hoc Information Retrieval
2.	Sentiment Analysis of the document
3.	Text clustering
4.	Feature extraction

## Why embedded topic model?
When topic models are built utilizing word frequency or tf-idf scores, the words do not capture the semantic and syntactic meaning of words in a  sentence. In this way, we lose so many important information and see similar content on different topics. To eliminate this problem, an embedded topic model helps.
